            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already 
            the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black 
            and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. 
            Theyâ€™re sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match. </p>
